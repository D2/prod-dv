I finally decided to pull the trigger and setup a blog. I've been taking on some reasonably interesting projects aswell as rebuilding my home-lab, this seemed like a good way to keep a running log that might also be useful for somebody else.

I built the blog using {{< autolink "hugo" "https://gohugo.io" >}}, a static site generator focused on being *really* quick and incredibly easy to use. If you need a reference frame for how easy hugo is to use, look no further than this blog which was setup in under a day.

I'm planning on making another post later down the line about my experiences using {{< autolink "hugo" "https://gohugo.io" >}} and maybe share some insight/useful info.
