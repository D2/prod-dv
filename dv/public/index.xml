      <description>I finally decided to pull the trigger and setup a blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking on some reasonably interesting projects aswell as rebuilding my home-lab, this seemed like a good way to keep a running log that might also be useful for somebody else.
I built the blog using hugo, a static site generator focused on being really quick and incredibly easy to use. If you need a reference frame for how easy hugo is to use, look no further than this blog which was setup in under a day.</description>
