    <p>I finally decided to pull the trigger and setup a blog. I&rsquo;ve been taking on some reasonably interesting projects aswell as rebuilding my home-lab, this seemed like a good way to keep a running log that might also be useful for somebody else.</p>
<p>I built the blog using hugo.js, a static site generator focused on being <em>really</em> quick and incredibly easy to use. If you need a reference frame for how easy hugo is to use, look no further than this blog which was setup in under a day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning on making another post later down the line about my experiences using hugo and maybe share some insight/useful info.</p>
